        <h3>A Distinctive Korean Boardgame with a Long History</h3>
        <p>
          Yut or yut nori is a traditional Korean boardgame played by two
          opposing players or teams tossing four tokens made by splitting wooden
          dowels into halves. Players cast the yut sticks, and the resulting
          combination of sticks facing up (round side up) or down (flat side up)
          determines how many spaces a token can advance on a yut board with 29
          stations. The team who runs all four of its tokens through the course
          first wins. Games using some form of dice are common across the globe.
          However, the Korean boardgame of yut is distinguished by the profound
          symbolic meaning it carries in the traditional Korean consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The origins of what is known as yut nori today are estimated to trace
          as far back as the Three Kingdoms Period (57 BCE–668 CE). It is
          recorded in a Chinese document that people in Baekje, one of the three
          ancient kingdoms occupying the Korean Peninsula, played jeopo (chupu
          in Chinese). The ancient Chinese chess game chupu differs from yut
          nori. It has a four-token system with tokens in black and white and a
          board consisting of 360 stations. It is thought that the Korean
          version was mistaken by the Chinese for the more familiar chupu. The
          eighth-century collection of songs known as Manyo syu from Japan
          contains, in its discussion of the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla,
          phrases thought to describe different combinations of yut sticks
          facing up or down. Some Korean documents from the Goryeo era
          (918–1392) include records on a yut board and its 29 stations. In the
          Joseon period (1392–1910), the term yut or yut nori was widely used
          along with synonyms such as sahui and cheoksa. Yut nori came to earn
          enormous popularity as an inter-neighborhood competition on Jeongwol
          Daeboreum (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) during the 20th
          century. Playing yut on Seollal (Lunar New Year) and Jeongwol
          Daeboreum has been actively transmitted to the present as an important
          aspect of traditional Korean culture. Contemporary Koreans throw yut
          sticks at family gatherings, community events, and in the school
          curriculum.

            Astronomical Knowledge Embodied in the Yut Board
          </h3>

            Historical documents from the 17th and 18th centuries contain
            drawings of a yut board in the form of a circle dissected by a cross
            along with written accounts. According to these records, the outer
            circle represents heaven and the inner space divided into four
            sections by the cross symbolize the land. The central station on the
            yut board refers to the pole star, and the remaining 28 stations are
            the 28 asterisms as defined in traditional East Asian astronomy. It
            can be said that the yut board epitomizes the entire celestial
            sphere. In addition, the four courses a token can take on the yut
            board signify the length of the day: The longest and shortest
            courses respectively represent the summer and winter solstices, and
            the two middle courses refer to the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.
            There are four yut sticks for each team because there are four
            seasons, and the flat and round sides of each stick symbolize the
            opposing forces of yin and yang. The configurations into which the
            yut sticks fall after a throw are further associated with five
            different species of livestock. There are five different
            combinations, each with its own name: do (one stick facing down),
            gae (two sticks facing down), geol (three sticks facing down), yut
            (all four sticks facing down), and mo (all four sticks facing up).
            The number of sticks facing down equals the number of steps a token
            can move on the board, except for mo, which is worth five steps.
            These five configurations—do, gae, geol, yut, and mo—are believed to
            refer to the pig, dog, goat, ox, and horse.

        <h3>Yut Board Petroglyphs to Appeal to the Divine</h3>
        <p>
          Petroglyphs believed to represent a yut board have been found across
          the Korean Peninsula. These rock carvings range widely in time from
          the late Bronze Age to the late Joseon era. To date, 281 yut-board
          petroglyphs have been discovered at 85 sites on the Korean Peninsula
          and Manchuria. There is another reported to be in Ji’an, an area
          belonging to China today that was once ruled by the ancient Korean
          kingdom of Goguryeo. Rock carvings of a yut board mostly occur in
          mountains, but there are also examples found within the complex of a
          Buddhist temple, on the foundation stone of a building, and on the
          capstone of a dolmen. Given the locations in which these petroglyphs
          are found, they would not have been used for yut games. It is
          estimated that a yut board was carved in these places to deliver
          people’s prayers to heaven. The yut board petroglyphs are generally
          understood to express four sets of the seven stars forming the Big
          Dipper, with the pole star in the middle. According to this
          interpretation, the seven stars of the Big Dipper run counterclockwise
          from the pole star. The direction that tokens move on the yut board is
          similarly to the left. The left side has long been associated in
          Korean culture with the opposite of the quotidian. For example, a
          straw rope was twisted to the right-hand side for everyday purposes,
          but it was made by twisting the straws leftward for hanging in a
          household expecting a baby or at a shrine housing the tutelary god of
          the community. Various forms of traditional performing arts feature
          movements toward the left, such as in farmer’s music (nongak), mask
          dance (talchum), and the ganggangsullae circle dance. A turn to the
          left signifies a break with the everyday and symbolizes the sacred. A
          stone-piled tomb in Ji’an bears a carved representation of a yut
          board. There are also Goguryeo-era tombs with a mural of the 28
          asterisms. It is inferred that Koreans of the past carved the stars in
          the celestial sphere in the form of a yut board to express their
          wishes to the heavens. These rock carvings can be interpreted as part
          of a religious ritual rather than a game object.

          <h3>Desirable Characteristics as a Game</h3>
          <p>
            Besides its extended history and rich symbolism, yut nori has many
            advantages as a form of entertainment that has sustained its
            vitality to the present. First of all, yut nori is heavily dependent
            on luck, so those with little experience have no less chance to win
            than skilled players. There are, of course, elements of skill in yut
            nori, but the bottom line is that there is no way to control how
            many yut sticks will land face up or down. This predominant aspect
            of luck enhances the expectations of victory by every player and
            involves them strongly in the game. Secondly, yut nori is
            competitive. There are rules making the results unpredictable and
            enhancing the fun of the game. The tokens of one team can overtake
            or be overtaken by those of the opposing team, and the overtaken
            tokens are removed from the yut board to start again from the home
            station. Tokens can either move separately or collectively along the
            course. The route a token can take comes in four types: moving in a
            full circle, moving along the lines of a semicircle in the right
            half of the board, a semicircle in the lower half of the board, or a
            quarter in the lower-right of the board. Third, yut nori is not
            restricted by the availability of game pieces. Yut sticks are
            normally made from wood, but beans can also be used. Beans are cut
            into halves, placed in a small dish, and thrown from it. Beyond
            these, anything can be used, such as small stones, go beads, or
            pieces of wood. Yut games can be played indoors and out. A yut board
            is usually drawn on paper or cloth, but it can also be scratched
            into the ground. Fourth, there are diverse variants of yut nori. The
            game can also be played with retreating one step. To do this, one of
            the sticks is marked on the flat side. When the marked stick lands
            facing down and the others face up, the player must move one space
            back rather than one space forward. There is a form of yut nori that
            goes with a mental image of the board without its physical presence
            or that is designed for the specific needs of those without sight. A
            version of yut can be played by tossing and catching yut sticks like
            in jackstones. Fifth, yut nori enhances communication and boosts a
            sense of belonging within the community. Yut games take place among
            family members, within communities, and between neighborhoods at
            both the individual and group levels. The rules of play are not
            difficult and therefore draw people in, and there are no limits on
            the number of participants. People playing as a group have to
            constantly engage in conversation to create a strategy for how to
            move their tokens. From the start of the new year to the first
            full-moon day, many Korean families and neighborhoods are buzzing
            over yut nori. Finally, yut nori incorporates artistic and
            educational elements. There are traditional songs adopting the
            different configurations of yut sticks as the main theme, and yut
            games often invoke spontaneous dances out of excitement. Yut nori is
            recently being deployed as an element in local festivals and as part
            of the school curriculum. All of these features of yut nori have
            conspired to maintain the robust popularity of the game into the
            present.
