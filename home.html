            <h3>A Distinctive Korean Boardgame with a Long History</h3>
            <p>Yut or yut nori is a traditional Korean boardgame played by two opposing players or teams tossing four tokens made by
            splitting wooden dowels into halves. Players cast the yut sticks, and the resulting combination of sticks facing up
            (round side up) or down (flat side up) determines how many spaces a token can advance on a yut board with 29 stations.
            The team who runs all four of its tokens through the course first wins. Games using some form of dice are common across
            the globe. However, the Korean boardgame of yut is distinguished by the profound symbolic meaning it carries in the
            traditional Korean consciousness.</p>
            <p>The origins of what is known as yut nori today are estimated to trace as far back as the Three Kingdoms Period (57
            BCE–668 CE). It is recorded in a Chinese document that people in Baekje, one of the three ancient kingdoms occupying the
            Korean Peninsula, played jeopo (chupu in Chinese). The ancient Chinese chess game chupu differs from yut nori. It has a
            four-token system with tokens in black and white and a board consisting of 360 stations. It is thought that the Korean
            version was mistaken by the Chinese for the more familiar chupu. The eighth-century collection of songs known as Manyo
            syu from Japan contains, in its discussion of the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla, phrases thought to describe different
            combinations of yut sticks facing up or down. Some Korean documents from the Goryeo era (918–1392) include records on a
            yut board and its 29 stations. In the Joseon period (1392–1910), the term yut or yut nori was widely used along with
            synonyms such as sahui and cheoksa. Yut nori came to earn enormous popularity as an inter-neighborhood competition on
            Jeongwol Daeboreum (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) during the 20th century. Playing yut on Seollal (Lunar
            New Year) and Jeongwol Daeboreum has been actively transmitted to the present as an important aspect of traditional
            Korean culture. Contemporary Koreans throw yut sticks at family gatherings, community events, and in the school
            curriculum.</p>

                <img src="images/Yut4.jpg" height="500" align="left" />
                <p align="right">Historical documents from the 17th and 18th centuries contain drawings of a yut board in the form of a circle
                    dissected
                    by a cross along with written accounts. According to these records, the outer circle represents heaven and the inner
                    space divided into four sections by the cross symbolize the land. The central station on the yut board refers to the
                    pole star, and the remaining 28 stations are the 28 asterisms as defined in traditional East Asian astronomy. It can
                    be
                    said that the yut board epitomizes the entire celestial sphere. In addition, the four courses a token can take on
                    the
                    yut board signify the length of the day: The longest and shortest courses respectively represent the summer and
                    winter
                    solstices, and the two middle courses refer to the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. There are four yut sticks for each
                    team because there are four seasons, and the flat and round sides of each stick symbolize the opposing forces of yin
                    and
                    yang. The configurations into which the yut sticks fall after a throw are further associated with five different
                    species
                    of livestock. There are five different combinations, each with its own name: do (one stick facing down), gae (two
                    sticks
                    facing down), geol (three sticks facing down), yut (all four sticks facing down), and mo (all four sticks facing
                    up).
                    The number of sticks facing down equals the number of steps a token can move on the board, except for mo, which is
                    worth
                    five steps. These five configurations—do, gae, geol, yut, and mo—are believed to refer to the pig, dog, goat, ox,
                    and
                    horse.</p>

            <h3>Yut Board Petroglyphs to Appeal to the Divine</h3>
            <p>Petroglyphs believed to represent a yut board have been found across the Korean Peninsula. These rock carvings range
            widely in time from the late Bronze Age to the late Joseon era. To date, 281 yut-board petroglyphs have been discovered
            at 85 sites on the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria. There is another reported to be in Ji’an, an area belonging to China
            today that was once ruled by the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Rock carvings of a yut board mostly occur in
            mountains, but there are also examples found within the complex of a Buddhist temple, on the foundation stone of a
            building, and on the capstone of a dolmen. Given the locations in which these petroglyphs are found, they would not have
            been used for yut games. It is estimated that a yut board was carved in these places to deliver people’s prayers to
            heaven. The yut board petroglyphs are generally understood to express four sets of the seven stars forming the Big
            Dipper, with the pole star in the middle. According to this interpretation, the seven stars of the Big Dipper run
            counterclockwise from the pole star. The direction that tokens move on the yut board is similarly to the left. The left
            side has long been associated in Korean culture with the opposite of the quotidian. For example, a straw rope was
            twisted to the right-hand side for everyday purposes, but it was made by twisting the straws leftward for hanging in a
            household expecting a baby or at a shrine housing the tutelary god of the community. Various forms of traditional
            performing arts feature movements toward the left, such as in farmer’s music (nongak), mask dance (talchum), and the
            ganggangsullae circle dance. A turn to the left signifies a break with the everyday and symbolizes the sacred. A
            stone-piled tomb in Ji’an bears a carved representation of a yut board. There are also Goguryeo-era tombs with a mural
            of the 28 asterisms. It is inferred that Koreans of the past carved the stars in the celestial sphere in the form of a
            yut board to express their wishes to the heavens. These rock carvings can be interpreted as part of a religious ritual
            rather than a game object.</p>
